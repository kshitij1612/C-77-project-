        In javascript, the console is an object which provides access to the browser debugging console. We can open a
        console in web browser by using: Ctrl + Shift + I for windows and Command + Option + I for Mac. The console
        object provides us with several different methods, like :

        log()
        error()
        warn()
        clear()
        time() and timeEnd()
        table()
        count()
        group() and groupEnd()
        custom console logs
    </p>

    <script>
        var about_me = "Hello, I am kshitij bhaskar. This is my first web console screen."
        console.log(about_me);

        var first_name = "Kshitij";
        var last_name = "Bhaskar";

        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
        console.log(full_name);

        var a = 10;
        var b = 50;

        var add = a + b;
        console.log(add);
    </script>
